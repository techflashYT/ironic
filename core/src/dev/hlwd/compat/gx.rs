/// Legacy GX GPU
/// XXX: double-check these descriptions, to the best I can tell
/// from checking Dolphin this is where each of these things land,
/// but they're quite interconnected so it's annoying to tell
///
/// This isn't really a single MMIO device, rather a bunch of intertwined
/// units, all a part of the GX pipeline, some of which have MMIO regions.
///
/// - The Command Processor (CP) decodes commands out of the FIFO, sending
///   them off to whichever unit needs them.
/// - The Pixel Engine (PE) does several things, including notably
///   the EFB -> XFB copy.
/// - The Blitting Processor (BP) does several things, notably being an
///   interface for some PE functions (like the EFB -> XFB copy), as well
///   as dealing with texturing, scaling, and more.
